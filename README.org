# Project template for OCaml projects



Code should be structured roughly like this:

    project/
        Makefile
        README
        ChangeLog
        ...
        src/
            program.ml
            interface.mli
            ...
        tests/
            ...
    
Make sure to change the program name near the top of the Makefile.
